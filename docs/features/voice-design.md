Core Features

# Voice Design

Copy pageCopy page

Generate candidate voices from a prompt

Copy pageCopy page

Voice Design creates short voice candidates from a natural-language prompt. Use it when you want to explore a voice direction before building a longer text-to-speech workflow or creating a persistent voice model.

## API reference

Every parameter for `POST /v1/voice-design`.

## Pricing

Voice Design is billed per successful generation request.

## Voice cloning

Create a reusable voice model from reference audio.

## 

​

When to use it

## Explore voice concepts

Generate several candidate voices from a short creative brief.

## Preview narration styles

Provide preview text to hear how a generated voice reads a specific line.

## Seed creative workflows

Use generated candidates to choose a voice direction before longer TTS production.

## Stateless API calls

Get generated audio directly without creating batches, samples, or voice models.

## 

​

Quick start

Send a JSON request with a prompt and receive generated candidates. The current candidate audio payload is WAV bytes encoded as base64.

API (curl)

Python

JavaScript
    
    
    curl --request POST https://api.fish.audio/v1/voice-design \
      --header "Authorization: Bearer $FISH_API_KEY" \
      --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
      --header "model: voice-design-1" \
      --data '{
        "instruction": "Warm, confident studio narrator with a natural tone",
        "reference_text": "Welcome to Fish Audio.",
        "language": "en",
        "n": 2
      }' | jq -r '.candidates[0].audio_base64' | base64 --decode > voice.wav
    
    
    
    import base64
    import os
    import requests
    
    response = requests.post(
        "https://api.fish.audio/v1/voice-design",

            "Content-Type": "application/json",

        timeout=120,
    )
    response.raise_for_status()
    
    candidate = response.json()["candidates"][0]
    with open("voice.wav", "wb") as f:
        f.write(base64.b64decode(candidate["audio_base64"]))
    
    print(candidate["sample_rate"], candidate["duration_ms"])
    
    
    
    import { writeFile } from "node:fs/promises";
    
    const response = await fetch("https://api.fish.audio/v1/voice-design", {
      method: "POST",
      headers: {
        Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.FISH_API_KEY}`,
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
        model: "voice-design-1",
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        instruction: "Warm, confident studio narrator with a natural tone",
        reference_text: "Welcome to Fish Audio.",
        language: "en",
        n: 2,
      }),
    });
    
    if (!response.ok)
      throw new Error(`${response.status} ${await response.text()}`);
    
    const { candidates } = await response.json();
    await writeFile("voice.wav", Buffer.from(candidates[0].audio_base64, "base64"));
    console.log(candidates[0].sample_rate, candidates[0].duration_ms);

Prompt and preview text

`instruction` is the main voice design prompt. Describe the voice, age, delivery, tone, accent, pacing, and context in natural language.
    
    
    {
      "instruction": "Energetic young presenter, bright tone, crisp diction, friendly but not cartoonish",
      "reference_text": "Here is your weekly product update.",
      "language": "en",
      "n": 3
    }
    

`reference_text` is optional. When you provide it, candidates read that text so you can compare voices on the same line. Keep it short; the API accepts up to 300 characters.

## 

​

Parameters

Field| Default| Notes  
---|---|---  
`instruction`| Required| Voice design prompt. 1 to 2000 characters.  
`reference_text`| `null`| Optional preview text. Up to 300 characters.  
`language`| `null`| Optional language hint such as `en`, `zh`, or `ja`.  
`n`| `2`| Number of candidates to generate. Range: 1 to 4.  
`speed`| `1.0`| Speaking speed multiplier. Must be greater than 0 and at most 3.  
`num_step`| `32`| Diffusion steps. Range: 1 to 128.  
`guidance_scale`| `2.0`| Higher values follow the prompt more strongly. Must be at least 0.  
`instruct_guidance_scale`| `0.0`| Prompt conditioning guidance. Must be at least 0.  
`seed`| `null`| Optional deterministic seed for candidate generation.  
  
Voice Design accepts JSON only. Do not send MessagePack, multipart form data, inline reference audio, or service-internal fields such as `features`, `features_json_file`, or `include_audio_base64`.

## 

​

Response

The response contains one or more generated candidates:
    
    
    {
      "candidates": [
        {
          "id": "candidate-id",
          "index": 0,
          "audio_base64": "UklGRg...",
          "sample_rate": 44100,
          "duration_ms": 3100,
          "text": "Welcome to Fish Audio.",
          "language": "en"
        }
      ]
    }
    

Use `index` to preserve the order returned by the model. `id` is a stable candidate identifier for this response. Optional fields such as `text`, `instruct`, and `language` appear only when available.

## 

​

Billing and errors

Voice Design is billed once per successful generation request, not once per candidate. Authentication errors, validation errors, insufficient API credit, concurrency limits, upstream service errors, and empty candidate responses are not billed. For the full error format and retry guidance, see [Errors](https://docs.fish.audio/api-reference/errors).
